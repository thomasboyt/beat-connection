This is a small platformer, cobbled together out of bits and pieces of the small amounts of game dev I've done over the past couple years. I'm using it as a testbed for my GGPO clone, [Telegraph](https://github.com/thomasboyt/telegraph), and hope to turn it into some kind of semi-compelling versus game/"platform fighter."

It uses a home-rolled ECS that draws on the APIs of [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) and [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst), albiet with absolutely none of the performance optimizations. It uses [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) for state changes, as its use of copy-on-update and structural sharing _should_ theoretically make it is easy to maintain game state and perform rollbacks for Telegraph (at the cost of a whole lot of GC, I think).
